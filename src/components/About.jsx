			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>
				Am very passionate about software engineering and it has been a dream since i was 13 years old. I have been practising how to write code
				ever since using different technologies. Am now in my third year at Daeyang University studying Bachelors Degree in Software Engineering.
				Over the years i have been asking myself what i want to become, well a software engineer. I have realised that this field takes alot of
				effort and passion. Well thats something i have been developing and still developing. I build Games, Web, Desktop & Mobile apps.
				Some of the technologies am still perfecting myself but am surely getting there. I love making and listenig to music, yeaaah am a producer
				i mostly make beats totally love them. I also like chilling with people who share interesting ideas with me which can build the both of us.
				Uhh i almost forgot about my age, am 20 now. Looking forward to know more about what i do ? check out my github link below and most likely
				twitter. I think thats it about me üòÅ.
